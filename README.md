# DjangoProject
This is one of my first projects made with Django framework. The project is quite simple and has a purely educational motive.

The project itself is a site with 'famous women of the world'. At that time, nothing interesting came to my mind and I just took the idea from the tutorial.

If you want to deploy it on your own and feel it yourself, then also deploy the virtual environment on your platform and download the project.
